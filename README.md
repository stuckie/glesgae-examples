GLESGAE - GL ES Game Application Engine

GLESGAE is a minimalistic framework engine, designed to be as multi-platform as possible.
It's goal is more of an educational pursuit for the author, however it may be useful for others.
It will probably be in a constant state of flux for quite a while, so you're recommended to fork it at a particular point if you're wanting to use it.

These examples require the main engine's source code available: https://github.com/stuckie/glesgae
The Makefiles look for an environment variable - GLESGAE - which is the root path to the engine source.
